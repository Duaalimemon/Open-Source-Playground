# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code.  

**Key points:**
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Allows collaboration on projects
- Lets you revert to previous versions if needed

**Example commands:**
```bash
git init          # Initialize a new Git repository
git add .         # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Message"  # Commit changes
git push          # Push changes to remote repository
