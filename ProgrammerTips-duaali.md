# ðŸ’» Tips to Be a Good Programmer

A few practical habits and mindset shifts that can help you become a better programmer.

1. **Write Clean Code**  
   - Focus on readability and maintainability, not just making it work.  

2. **Keep Learning**  
   - Technology changes fast â€” keep exploring new languages, frameworks, and tools.  

3. **Practice Problem-Solving**  
   - Solve coding challenges regularly to sharpen your logic and algorithms.  

4. **Use Version Control (Git)**  
   - Learn Git basics (commit, branch, merge, pull requests) early.  

5. **Read Documentation**  
   - Good programmers rely on official docs instead of random guesses.  

6. **Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**  
   - Reuse code with functions, modules, or components instead of duplicating.  

7. **Write Comments & Meaningful Names**  
   - Explain *why* you wrote something, not just *what*.  

8. **Test Your Code**  
   - Write small test cases or use frameworks to catch bugs early.  

9. **Debug Systematically**  
   - Use breakpoints, logs, and step-by-step analysis instead of random fixes.  

10. **Learn from Others**  
   - Read open-source code, pair program, or contribute to projects.  

11. **Think Before You Code**  
   - Break problems into smaller steps, then start coding.  

12. **Balance Speed with Quality**  
   - Donâ€™t rush to finish â€” write code that future-you will thank you for.
