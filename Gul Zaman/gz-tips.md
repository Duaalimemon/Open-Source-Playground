Here are some **useful Flutter tips** for you 🚀📱

1. 🧩 **Use const widgets** wherever possible → improves performance.
2. 📦 **Organize your project** into folders (screens, widgets, models, services) → keeps code clean.
3. 🔄 **Hot Reload wisely** → restart the app when making changes in initialization or main.dart.
4. 🎨 **Use ThemeData** for colors, fonts, and styles → makes UI consistent.
5. 🛠️ **Use Flutter DevTools** → helps debug memory, performance, and widget tree.
6. 📱 **Responsive UI** → use `MediaQuery` or `LayoutBuilder` for different screen sizes.
7. 🔑 **State Management** → start simple (`setState`) and move to Provider, Riverpod, or GetX for larger apps.
8. 🖼️ **Optimize images** → use smaller assets or `cached_network_image` for better performance.
9. ⚡ **Avoid rebuilding widgets unnecessarily** → extract into stateless widgets.
10. 📝 **Use meaningful widget & variable names** → makes code readable for you and others.
