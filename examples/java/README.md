## Contributing Java Examples

Feel free to add more Java examples! Some ideas:
- Simple calculator with classes
- Basic inheritance examples
- File I/O operations
- ArrayList/HashMap usage
- Exception handling examples

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use meaningful class and variable names
- Follow Java naming conventions (CamelCase for classes, camelCase for methods)
- Add JavaDoc comments for methods and classes
- Keep classes focused on single responsibility

### File Naming
- Java files must match the class name: `HelloWorld.java` contains `class HelloWorld`
- Use PascalCase for class names

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
